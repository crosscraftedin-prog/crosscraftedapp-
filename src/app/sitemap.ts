 * Next.js MetadataRoute.Sitemap convention — auto-served at /sitemap.xml.

 * Generates a dynamic sitemap combining the static marketing pages with
 * every published blog post (only published — drafts and future-scheduled
 * posts are NOT included since they aren't publicly reachable).
 *
 * The static `public/sitemap.xml` was deleted in favour of this file so
 * Next.js is the single source of truth for /sitemap.xml.
 *
 * ROBUSTNESS: if the database is unreachable (e.g., during local builds
 * without a Postgres URL, or during a transient outage), fall back to
 * returning just the static URLs so the sitemap is still served.
